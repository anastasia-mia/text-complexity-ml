result = predict_text_level("On the weekend, I like to relax and enjoy my free time. I usually wake up later than on weekdays, and I make a big breakfast with eggs and toast. After that, I clean my room and do some light chores. In the afternoon, I sometimes meet my friends in the park, and we walk, talk, and drink coffee. In the evening, I watch a movie or listen to music at home. My weekend is simple, but it makes me feel happy and rested.")
